# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, this project is in the R&D stage, and no official versions have been released yet. Security updates will be provided once the project reaches a stable release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, please report it using one of the following methods:

- **GitHub Issues**: Open a new issue on the GitHub repository.
- **Email**: Send a detailed report to admin [at] chooyijie [dot] com.

If you do not receive a response within a reasonable time (please check your spam folder), kindly open an issue on GitHub.

### Confidentiality and Encryption

To maintain confidentiality, all security-related reports must be encrypted using my OpenPGP key, which can be found on my GitHub homepage (yijiechoo16163). 

1. Encrypt your report with my public key.
2. Submit the encrypted message via GitHub issues or email.
3. Include your public key in the report, so I can respond with an encrypted message.

Only the repository owner, collaborators, and the bug submitter will be aware of the details of the vulnerability during the discovery and resolution process.
